<p> Hello! I'm Amkele Yamani, an ICT graduate with a specialization in Application Development, and a passion for creating practical, user-centered digital solutions. I completed my studies at Walter Sisulu University, earning a Diploma in Information Communication Technology with a focus on Application Development.
Growing up in a close-knit village community. Inspired by my family's unwavering support, I am committed to building my expertise and taking on new challenges in the tech field. My background includes hands-on experience in C# .NET Framework, Java, HTML5, CSS and I recently completed a Windows Forms project that integrates with an MS Access database, showcasing my skills in software development and database management.
I'm now looking to leverage my knowledge in a App Developer role within IT, where I can contribute to a team and continue learning. Thank you for visiting my portfolioâ€”I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I've enjoyed creating it!</p>
